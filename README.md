# 🏛️ Unity Gate (Birlik Kapısı) - Stoic AI Core

### "Solving Loneliness with Ancient Philosophy & Modern AI"

This repository contains the training code for a custom **Llama-3 (8B)** model, fine-tuned to act as a psychological companion based on **Stoic Philosophy** (Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, Epictetus).

### 🚀 Why This Exists?
I am a 19-year-old founder building **Unity Gate** to solve the global loneliness crisis. Since I did not have a massive budget for H100 clusters, I utilized **Unsloth** and free cloud GPUs to achieve state-of-the-art results with limited resources.

### 🛠️ Engineering Stack
* **Base Model:** Meta Llama-3 (8B)
* **Optimization:** Unsloth (LoRA / QLoRA for 2x faster training)
* **Dataset:** Custom-curated "Stoic & Empathy" dataset (JSONL)
* **Environment:** Google Colab (Free Tier Hacking)

### 🧠 The Mission
This is not just a chatbot. It is a **Reasoning Engine** designed to listen to users' distress and respond not with generic advice, but with resilient, stoic wisdom.
